				
FINAL REPORT 

 The application I was fortunate to work on this semester is called the NBA Fantasy Draft Helper. The reason why I created this application is because I stumbled across an information problem while drafting for my NBA fantasy league. So there is no website that looks at a player's statistics side by side and none that suggests who will be the best selection for your NBA fantasy roster.Also there was no tool that will give me suggestions on which player to draft in my fantasy I will have to manually search through websites to find statistics and compare player statistics. This poised as an issue and I decided to create a website to solve this problem. The stakeholders or users of my product will be NBA Fantasy Draft participants these are users who annually participate in the NBA fantasy league.This tool will help those who participate in the NBA fantasy league make better decisions for their roster. Also NBA fans could use this to keep up to date with their favorite basketball player statistics and how they compare to other players. So the 

Languages/frameworks/ Apiâ€™s I used consist of the following:- 
NBA Player Statistics API:https://www.suredbits.com/api/nba/stats/
This API allowed be to get the most up to date NBA player statistics the league has to offer. This was a key feature in my design that I needed to implement in order for my web application to my information problem. 

NBA HEADSHOT API : https://nba-players.herokuapp.com/
This API allowed for the user to see the visual headshot of the player they searched. This API allowed for my webpage to show images of the player they searched by providing a link of the image to the table created by my code.

SQL DB
Used to Store the data. 

HTML/CSS
Used to create attractive front-end user interface.
Making the application look as good as it works

After final developing my application a lot of things changed from my midterm presentation one of the being my file structure for the projects. I thought using alot of independent files will make it easier for me but it ended up becoming more of a nuisance so I decided to reduce the length of files I needed.In order for my applications to be used in the real world the web design will have to be revamped. It will have more interactive features such as: comparing player teams, looking up team statistics, postseason statistics and incorporate a better database.Overall my experience with this project was great I ended up creating an application that does exactly what I want it to do and plan on using this for my portfolio in the future. I will like to thank my professor for being patient with me and seeing me through this final assignment. This will not be feasible without his support.
